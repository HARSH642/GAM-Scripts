# Purpose: For a Google Drive User(s), delete all duplicate drive files
# Note: This script requires Advanced GAM:
#	https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-X, https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD, https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3
# Customize: Set FILE_NAME and CREATED_DATE based on your environment.
# Usage:
# 1: Get information for all files, if you don't want all users, replace all users with your user selection in the command below
#    These fields are required: fields id,title,createddate,mimetype fullpath
#    You can add additional fields that will be preserved in the output.
#    You can add a select option if you want to only process files in a specific folder
#    If you don't want to delete folders, add showmimetype not gfolder
#  $ gam redirect csv ./UserFiles.csv multiprocess all users print filelist fields id,title,createddate,mimetype,owners.emailaddress fullpath
#  $ gam redirect csv ./UserFiles.csv user user@domain.com print filelist fields id,title,createddate,mimetype,owners.emailaddress fullpath
#                               select drivefilename "Folder Name" showmimetype not gfolder
# 2: From that list of files, output a CSV file with the same headers as the input CSV file
#    that lists the drive file Ids that have the same owner, title, mimeType and paths with a createdDate older than the most recent createdDate
#  $ python DeleteDuplicateFiles.py ./UserFiles.csv ./DuplicateFiles.csv
# 3: Inspect DuplicateFiles.csv, verify that it makes sense and then proceed
# 4: Delete the duplicate files
#  $ gam redirect stdout ./DeleteDuplicateFiles.log multiprocess redirect stderr stdout csv ./DuplicateFiles.csv gam user "~Owner" delete drivefile "~id"
