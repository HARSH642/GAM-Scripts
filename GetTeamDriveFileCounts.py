# Purpose: Get file counts for Team Drives
# Note: This script requires Advanced GAM with Team Drive support:
#	https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD, https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3
# Customize: DOMAIN_LIST
# Usage:
# 1: If you want to include all Team Drives, do this step and then skip to step 4, otherwise start at step 2.
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDrives.csv print teamdrives role organizer fields id,name
# 2: If want Team Drives for a specific set of organizers, replace <UserTypeEntity> with your user selection in the command below
#  $ gam redirect csv ./AllTeamDrives.csv <UserTypeEntity> print teamdrives role organizer fields id,name
# 3: Delete duplicate Team Drives (some may have multiple organizers). Make sure that ID_FIELD = 'id' in DeleteDuplicateRows.py
#  $ python DeleteDuplicateRows.py ./AllTeamDrives.csv ./TeamDrives.csv
# 4: Get ACLs for all Team Drives
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDriveACLs.csv multiprocess csv TeamDrives.csv gam print drivefileacls ~id
# 5: From that list of ACLs, output a CSV file with headers "id,name,organizer"
#    that shows an organizer/fileOrganizer for each Team Drive
#  $ python GetTeamDriveFileCounts.py TeamDriveACLs.csv TeamDrives.csv TeamDriveOrganizers.csv
# 6: From that list of organizers, get the file counts for all Team Drives that have an organizer (matchfield organizer "^.+$")
#  $ gam redirect csv ./TeamDriveFileCounts.csv multiprocess csv TeamDriveOrganizers.csv matchfield organizer "^.+$"  gam user ~organizer print filecounts select teamdriveid ~id
# 7: You can identify all Team Drives without an organizer
#  $ gam csv TeamDriveOrganizers.csv skipfield organizer "^.+$" gam info teamdrive teamdriveid ~id
